Steal the lights from our eyes
Take my blood from my heart
We're in all of this dark matter
Take the breaths from my chest
Take the pulse and I'm outta line
We're losing time, dark matter
Denounce the demagogues
King diamond to discard
Deplore the dialogue
Your word against the law
It's strange these days
When everybody else pays
For someone else's mistake
This blame takes shape
Still everybody else pays
For someone else's mistake
You're running away
We're pulling apart
In all of this dark matter
I once heard a sin
And now it's stuck in my head
Or is it the press?
No one knows what happens next
Renounce the demigods
King diamond to discard
Deplore the dialogue
Your word against the law
It's strange these days
When everybody else pays
For someone else's mistake
This blame takes shape
Still everybody else pays
For someone else's mistake
No tolerance for intolerance, intolerance for-
No patience left for impatience no more
No love lost for lost loves
No sorrow for the unaccountable
It's strange these days
When everybody else pays
For someone else's mistake
This blame takes shape
Still everybody else pays
For someone else's mistake
