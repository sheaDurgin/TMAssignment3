Panic attack, the backing track
A background hum for cerebellum
Oh, what a blessing to meet someone like you
With eyes as dead as mine, it's fine
It's normal people things just to lie here in silence
Spending days in self-medicating
Lost too much weight
Unpleasant aftertaste
We think the same, play different games
Since I like to refuse, hope you blink before I do
Then pray and pray that you'll go and do it anyway
Hold your breath, I'll make it worth the wait
Hold your breath to your chest
And come back and see me, yeah
You rub the makeup off my neck
That I was using to hide the stubble rash
I gave myself while shaving
Yes, it's probably a razor thing but honestly, it's harmless
I refuse to let the sensitive skin win
Oh, what a blessing (blessing) to meet someone like you
With eyes as dead as mine, it's fine
It's normal people things just to lie here in silence
So, we lie here in silence
Just lie here in silence
Yes, it's normal people things
Just to lie here in silence
Hold your breath, I'll make it worth the wait
Hold your breath to your chest
And come back and see me, yeah
Hold your breath to your chest
And come back and see me
