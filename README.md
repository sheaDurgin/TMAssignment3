## Task 1
This task scrapes from lyrics.com, to get genre-to-lyrics pairs. 
At the end it will create three files, train.tsv, val.tsv, test.tsv. 
This data is a 80:10:10 split of the total data scraped. 

Simply run `python task1.py`. 
This will take hours to run, which is why we have provided the resulting tsvs.
