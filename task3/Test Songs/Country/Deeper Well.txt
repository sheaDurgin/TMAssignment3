My Saturn has returned
When I turned 27
Everything started to change
Took a long time, but I learned
There's two kinds of people
One is a giver, and one's always trying to take
All they can take
So, I'm saying goodbye
To the people that I feel are real good at wasting my time
No regrets, baby
I just think that maybe
You go your way and I'll go mine
It's been a real good time
But you've got dark energy
Something I can't unsee
And I've got to take care of myself
I've found a deeper well
I used to wake and bake
Roll out of bed, hit the gravity bong that I made
And start the day
For a while, it got me by
Everything I did seemed better when I was high
I don't know why
So, I'm getting rid of the habits that I feel are real good at wasting my time
No regrets, baby
I just think that maybe it's natural when things lose their shine
So other things can glow
I've gotten older, now I know
How to take care of myself
I've found a deeper well
Hmm
When I was growing up
We had what we needed
Shoes on our feet, but the world was as flat as a plate
And that's okay
The things I was taught only took me so far, had to figure the rest out myself
And then I found
I found a deeper well
Hmm, mmm
