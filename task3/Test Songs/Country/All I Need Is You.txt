I want a Tracker boat on a big blue lake
And a brand new truck in my driveway
A lotto ticket worth a million bucks
And a bigger one on the wall
I want my boy's ball team to win
Waylon on the radio again
I want what I want
But hey, don't we all
When that sun goes down at the end of the day
There's just one thing I can't lose
If you're by my side I'm better than alright
Baby, all I need is you
I wanna take a trip in a Chevrolet
To a beach house down on 30A
Have the Gulf Of Mexico sittin' right in my backyard
But as long as you're right here in my arms
When that sun goes down at the end of the day
There's just one thing I can't lose
If you're by my side I'm better than alright
Baby, all I need is
You in the morning, you in the night
You every day for the rest of my life
You and me together 'til the day I die
I'm all yours if you're all mine
Baby, you're all mine
Now baby, look at you
You're my wildest dream
I could give it all up
And still have everything
When that sun goes down at the end of the day
There's just one thing I can't lose
If you're by my side I'm better than alright
Baby, all I need is you
All I need is you
Baby, all I need is you
All I need is you
