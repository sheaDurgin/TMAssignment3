This love is gettin' kind of dangerous
Feels like it's a loaded gun
My-my, it's turning like a cloud of dust
My heart always wants to run
Oh, oh, oh-oh
If you want a cowboy on a white horse
Ridin' off into the sunset
If that's the kind of love you wanna wait for
Hold on tight, girl, I ain't there yet
No, I ain't there yet
No, I ain't there yet
White horse
Someday, maybe you could have your way
Right now's just not the time
Something a man just got to do
I wish you could change my mind
Oh, oh, oh-oh
If you want a cowboy on a white horse
Ridin' off into the sunset
If that's the kind of love you wanna wait for
Hold on tight, girl, I ain't there yet
No, I ain't there yet
No, I ain't there yet
White horse
If you want a cowboy on a white horse
Ridin' off into the sunset
If that's the kind of love you wanna wait for
Hold on tight, girl, I ain't there
If you want a cowboy on a white horse
Ridin' off into the sunset
If that's the kind of love you wanna wait for
Hold on tight, girl, I ain't there yet
No, I ain't there yet
No, I ain't there yet
White horse
