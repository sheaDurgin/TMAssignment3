I live in a little house on the side of the street
Where the grass is dead but they water the concrete
In the summer I watch the people float by
In the winter I watch them weep and cry, I
Live in a little house on the side of the street
I live in a little house on the side of the road
Where the people starve just to feed their cars and boats
In the fall, the men they stomp and shout
In the spring, the women frolic about, I
Live in a little house on the side of the road, yeah
Oh, try to believe
That work will set you free
Only wise men see that we were
Always free
I live in a place where the people wonder why
Why the grass is always greener on the other side
In the day they go to work and wait
In the night, they drink their fears away, I
Live in a place where the people wonder why
Oh, try to believe
That work will set you free
Only wise men see that we were
Always
We're always free
Yeah
Yeah
Oh, try to believe
That work will set you free
Oh, try to believe
That work will set you free
Only wise men see that we were
Always
Always free, yeah
We were always free
What the hell, nice
But I'll drink another drink, and then we'll do it again
