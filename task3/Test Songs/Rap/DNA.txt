I got, I got, I got, I got
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Quarter piece, got war, and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain, and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle, though, ambition flow inside my DNA
I was born like this
Since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this
Was Yeshua new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate
Then off your-, off your head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got
Realness, I just kill sh- 'cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then, win again like Wimbledon I serve
Yeah, that's him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a
B-, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Sh- I've been through prolly offend you
This is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction, burners, boosters
Burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids, and
I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier's DNA (I'ma soldier DNA)
Born inside the beast
My expertise checked out in second grade
When I was nine, on cell, motel
We didn't have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I'm supposed to antisocial, extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead this case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA (this is why I say that hip hop)
(Has done more damage to young African Americans) (I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA)
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, f- your life
(Than racism in recent years) (I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA)
(I live a be-, - your life)
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin' (five, four, three, two, one)
Money and power, the Mecca of marriages
Tell me somethin' (give me some ganja)
You motherfuckers can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation, your DNA, an abomination
This how it is when you're in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go, and sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy and walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder, these are the breaks
These are the times, level number nine
Look up in the sky, .10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherf-ker, I got winners on the way
You ain't sh- without a body on your belt
You ain't sh- without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith?
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder, our DNA
